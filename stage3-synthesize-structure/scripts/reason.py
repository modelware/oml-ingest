"""Taxonomy utilities and a lightweight reasoner.

Two jobs:

  1. **DAG utilities** the rest of Stage 3 needs: transitive ancestors, node
     depth, and the lowest common ancestor (LCA) used to lift a relation's
     domain/range to "the most general class that is still correct".

  2. **A lightweight consistency check** that closes the stage. A full OWL
     reasoner (HermiT/ELK) needs Java; here we check the two contradictions Stage
     3 can actually produce: a cycle in the ``subClassOf`` DAG (which makes its
     classes mutually sub/super, i.e. unsatisfiable) and a disjointness axiom that
     contradicts the subsumption it sits in. Following the article, an
     inconsistency is repaired by **relaxing the most suspect axiom first** (a
     coined disjointness before an extracted subClassOf), never by silently
     dropping a class. Every relaxation is recorded.
