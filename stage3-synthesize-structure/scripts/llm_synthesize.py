"""LLM ontology synthesis (Claude), fenced by the candidate vocabulary.

A purely bottom-up Stage 3 would build the taxonomy from lexical heads,
Hearst patterns, and clustering. This alternative lets an LLM *synthesize* a
parsimonious ontology instead, which gives a cleaner hierarchy and, crucially,
real domain/range on relations (the bottom-up co-occurrence heuristic's weak
point). The danger of LLM synthesis is hallucination, so it is fenced on both
ends:

  - it is given ONLY the grounded salient candidates and the Stage 0 scope, and
  - it is told to use the candidate labels as classes, omit redundant ones, and
    coin only a few clearly-needed abstract parents (which it must flag).

Anything it returns that is not a candidate (and not flagged coined) is treated as
an ungrounded introduction and flagged downstream, so grounding survives.

Two calls keep each response bounded and focused: one for the taxonomy, one for
the relations (domain/range over the synthesized classes). Model:
``claude-haiku-4-5`` (same as Stage 1), key from ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``.

    "Addition, Exponent, Base, Zero). Place each under its most specific correct "

    "verb-like phrases (Solve, Simplify, Translate, Evaluate), and one-off fragments.\n"
    "  - You MAY introduce abstract parent classes that are NOT in the list when a "
    "group of candidates shares an unnamed parent (e.g. ArithmeticOperation over "
    "Addition/Subtraction); mark each such class coined=true.\n"
