# Surface Candidates

This skill performs the **surfacing** step of ontology extraction: read a source
document and produce a high-recall bag of candidate ontology terms, both
**concepts** and **relations**, each tagged with its provenance. It is the first
step of a larger pipeline; later steps (naming the vocabulary, inducing
structure, reviewing) are out of scope here and are where pruning and structure
happen.

The single job of this step: **maximize recall of terms that could become
ontology elements, with zero structural commitment.** The input is a source
document; the output is a noisy *bag of candidate mentions*, each one a
concept-mention or a relation-mention. There are no parents, no edges, no
domain/range. Surfacing deliberately over-generates; precision is bought back
later.

## When to use this skill

- You have a source document (text or markdown) and want the candidate concepts
  and relations that could seed or grow an ontology.
- You need a clean, provenance-bearing candidate set for a downstream
  naming/structuring step to consume.
- The user asks to "surface candidates", "extract ontology terms / concepts", or
  "find candidate classes and relations".

Do **not** use this skill to build a taxonomy, assign parents, or prune terms.
Those belong to later steps. This step intentionally keeps everything plausible.

## Three design principles

- **Recall-first.** Nothing the text supports is dropped here. The junk filter
  removes only markup debris (table pipes, HTML entities, image paths), never
  plausible terms. Precision is recovered later, never now.
- **Provenance everywhere.** Every candidate carries where it came from: the
  extractor(s) that surfaced it and the exact character offsets of every literal
  occurrence in the original file. By construction, each recorded occurrence text
  equals `source[start:end]`.
- **Grounding by kind.** Each mention is typed now, `concept` or `relation`. What
  it means to justify it downstream depends on this kind.

## Mechanism: union of two extractors, then dedup

Neither extractor alone is enough. **The union is the point:** the spaCy
extractor cannot hallucinate but misses the implicit; the LLM catches the
implicit but can hallucinate.

### spaCy extractor: the recall floor and hallucination-free anchor

`scripts/spaCy_extractor.py`. Every candidate it emits is a literal span copied
out of the text, so it physically cannot invent a term that is not there.

**Concept mentions** come mostly from noun phrases, with POS/TAG/DEP used to
sharpen what counts:

- **NER** (`doc.ents`): named things.
- **Noun-phrase terms** (`doc.noun_chunks` whose head is a `NOUN`/`PROPN`, with
  leading determiners/possessives trimmed): the recall workhorse. Most concepts
  surface here, single-word (`fraction`, `integer`) and multi-word
  (`whole number`, `least common multiple`).
- **Gerund nominalizations** (`tag_ == VBG` in a nominal dependency role such as
  subject or object of a preposition): concepts whose head is a verb form, so
  `noun_chunks` never yields them (`rounding`, `factoring`, `graphing`).
- **Adjective qualities** (`pos_ == ADJ` in an `amod`/`acomp` role), **opt-in via
  `--adjectives`**, tagged `adj`: qualities of things (`prime`, `even`,
  `rational`, `divisible`). Off by default because it also surfaces generic
  adjectives (`available`, `basic`, `correct`); enable it when you want
  candidate qualities and will prune them downstream.

**Stop words are never surfaced on their own.** Every concept must keep at least
one non-stop content word, so a lone `two`, `it`, or `the` is dropped. Leading
determiners and pronouns are trimmed (`the foundation` → `foundation`), but
content words that merely sit on spaCy's stop list (`whole`, `first`) are kept,
so `whole numbers` stays intact. Function words inside a relation predicate (the
copula and prepositions in `is divisible by`) are kept on purpose.

**Relation mentions are not only verbs.** Relations live in several syntactic
shapes, and the extractor surfaces all of them, each as a contiguous literal span
so its offsets re-slice exactly to the predicate text:

| Shape | spaCy signal | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Bare verb | `pos_ == VERB` | `add`, `divide`, `simplify` |
| Verb + particle | verb + `prt` child | `add up`, `carry over`, `write out` |
| Verb + preposition | verb + `prep`/`agent` child | `divide by`, `consist of`, `depend on`, `rounded to` |
| Copular predicate | `be` + `acomp`/`attr` complement + preposition | `is divisible by`, `is equal to`, `is a multiple of` |

Notes on relation extraction:

- Bare auxiliaries and over-generic verbs (`be`, `have`, `do`, `make`, `use`,
  ...) are dropped as standalone relations, but `be` still seeds **copular**
  predicates (`is equal to`).
- Copular predicates require a preposition, so relational predicates
  (`is divisible by`) are kept while bare attributes (`is prime`) are not.
- Verb phrases are emitted *in addition to* the bare verb (recall-first), so
  `divided by` yields both `divide` and `divide by`.
- The dependency-parse extension is contiguous only; when an object interrupts
  the predicate (`divide the number by ...`), only the bare verb is emitted, so
  provenance offsets stay exact.

### LLM extractor (Claude): the complementary lift

`scripts/llm_extractor.py`, model `claude-haiku-4-5`. It catches the
multi-word, implicit, and relational candidates the spaCy methods miss (it reads
"the value left over after division" and proposes `Remainder` even though no
clean noun phrase names it). Two rules are enforced:

- **Terms only.** The model is prompted for two flat lists (concepts, relations).
  Any structure it volunteers (parents, hierarchy) is discarded, because
  structure is a later step's job and the model is least trustworthy exactly when
  it guesses hierarchy.
- **Tag the lift.** Every LLM term is tagged `llm`. The orchestrator then checks
  each term against the source: terms found verbatim earn literal-span
  provenance; terms not in the text are kept anyway (recall-first) but stay
  `literal_span: false` and `llm_only: true`, marking them for a harder look
  downstream.

The LLM API key is read from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in a `.env` file (an explicit
`--env` path, the environment, or the nearest `.env` walking up from the scripts
directory).

### Dedup: make the union a set

`scripts/dedup.py`. Lexical and morphological only: casefold, lemmatize, merge
string variants (`Whole Numbers` / `whole numbers` into one candidate keyed
`whole number`; `divides by` / `divided by` into `divide by`). Sources,
occurrences, and NER labels are pooled. This is **string-level** dedup;
meaning-level merging (`LCM` with `least common multiple`) is a harder operation
left to a later step.

## How to run

```bash
cd scripts
python surface_candidates.py <INPUT_FILE> [options]
```

The result is written next to the input as `<INPUT_FILE_stem>_candidates.json`.

Options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--no-llm` | off | spaCy extractor only. No API key needed; fully offline and deterministic. |
| `--adjectives` | off | Also surface adjective qualities (`ADJ` in `amod`/`acomp`) as concepts, tagged `adj`. Adds qualities like `prime`/`even` at the cost of generic-adjective noise. |
| `--model` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Claude model id for the LLM extractor. |
| `--spacy-model` | `en_core_web_sm` | spaCy model (must be installed). |
| `--llm-chunk-chars` | `8000` | Characters per LLM chunk. |
| `--llm-max-chunks` | `0` (all) | Cap LLM chunks, **evenly sampled** across the document, to bound cost/time. The spaCy extractor always covers the whole document. |
| `--env` | auto | Explicit path to a `.env` holding `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| `--output` | auto | Override the output path. |

Examples:

```bash
# Full pass: spaCy over the whole document, LLM over every chunk
python surface_candidates.py INPUT.md

# Bounded LLM cost on a large file: 12 evenly-sampled chunks
python surface_candidates.py INPUT.md --llm-max-chunks 12

# Offline, deterministic, no API calls
python surface_candidates.py INPUT.md --no-llm

# Also surface adjective qualities (prime, even, rational) as concepts
python surface_candidates.py INPUT.md --adjectives
```

      "literal_span": true,                // copied verbatim from source at least once, so not a hallucination
      "llm_only": false                    // only the LLM surfaced it (no hallucination-free backing)
    }
  ]
}
```

Source tags on `sources`:

- `ner`: spaCy named entity (concept).
- `term`: spaCy noun-phrase term or gerund nominalization (concept).
- `adj`: spaCy adjective quality (concept); only present with `--adjectives`.
- `verb`: spaCy syntactic predicate (relation), covering bare verbs, verb
  phrases, and copular predicates.
- `llm`: language-model proposal (concept or relation).

Useful flags for downstream steps:

- **`literal_span: false`**: an implicit candidate (described by the LLM but not
  present in the text verbatim). Kept by recall-first; needs grounding later.
- **`llm_only: true`**: no spaCy, hallucination-free extractor backed it. Worth a
  harder look downstream.
- **`sources` with more than one extractor**: agreement, a stronger candidate.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `spacy` with `en_core_web_sm` (`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`)
- `anthropic` (for the LLM extractor; not needed with `--no-llm`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in a `.env` file (for the LLM extractor)

## Output and what comes next

The artifact is a flat bag of typed, deduplicated, provenance-bearing candidate
mentions, and nothing else: no identity beyond string-level dedup, no structure.
A downstream naming step can take this bag and perform meaning-level grouping and
canonical labeling.

## Notes and limitations

- **Over-generation is intentional.** Document boilerplate (`Page`, `Step`,
  `EXAMPLE`, section titles) will appear as candidates. Recall-first forbids
  dropping them here. Do not "fix" this by tightening the filter past markup
  debris; pruning is a later step's job.
- **LLM failures degrade gracefully.** A network or parse error on a chunk skips
  that chunk (the spaCy floor still stands) rather than aborting the run.
- **Offsets are authoritative.** Occurrence offsets index the *original* input
  file; the recorded `text` is re-sliced from the source so it always equals
  `source[start:end]`.
- **Relation parsing depends on the spaCy model.** Verb phrases and copular
  predicates use the dependency parse; some predicates (for example certain
  comparatives) may not be caught by the spaCy extractor, but the LLM extractor
  covers the gap.
- **English by default.** The default spaCy model is English; pass
  `--spacy-model` for another language.
