"""LLM extractor: the complementary lift over the spaCy signals.

The spaCy extractor cannot hallucinate but misses the implicit; the LLM catches
the multi-word, implicit, and relational candidates the spaCy methods miss (it
reads "the value left over after division" and proposes ``Remainder`` even though
no clean noun phrase names it).

Two rules are enforced here:

  1. **Terms only.** The model is prompted for a flat list of terms. Any
     structure it volunteers (parents, hierarchy) is discarded: structure is a
     later step's job, and the model is least trustworthy exactly when it
     guesses hierarchy.

  2. **Tag the lift.** Whatever the LLM proposes is tagged ``llm``. The
     orchestrator then checks each term against the source text: terms found
     verbatim get literal-span provenance; terms that are *not* in the text are
     kept (recall-first) but stay ``llm_only`` and non-literal, so a later review
     can give them a harder look.

Model: ``claude-haiku-4-5`` via the ``anthropic`` SDK. The API key is
read from a ``.env`` file (``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``).
